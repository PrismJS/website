<h2>Full example</h2>
<pre><code>// The declaration creates a constructor that takes two values, name and age. 
type Person(name:string, age:int) =
    // A Person object's age can be changed. The mutable keyword in the 
    // declaration makes that possible. 
    let mutable internalAge = age

    // Declare a second constructor that takes only one argument, a name. 
    // This constructor calls the constructor that requires two arguments, 
    // sending 0 as the value for age. 
    new(name:string) = Person(name, 0)

    // A read-only property. 
    member this.Name = name
    // A read/write property. 
    member this.Age
        with get() = internalAge
        and set(value) = internalAge &lt;- value

    // Instance methods. 
    // Increment the person's age. 
    member this.HasABirthday () = internalAge &lt;- internalAge + 1

    // Check current age against some threshold. 
    member this.IsOfAge targetAge = internalAge &gt;= targetAge

    // Display the person's name and age. 
    override this.ToString () = 
        "Name:  " + name + "\n" + "Age:   " + (string)internalAge

<h2>Known failures</h2>
<p>There are certain edge cases where Prism will fail.
	There are always such cases in every regex-based syntax highlighter.
	However, Prism dares to be open and honest about them.
	If a failure is listed here, it doesn’t mean it will never be fixed. This is more of a “known bugs” list, just with a certain type of bug.
